                <h2>How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h2>
                <p>
                    A cryptocurrency is a digital, encrypted, and decentralized
                    medium of exchange. Unlike the U.S. Dollar or the Euro,
                    there is no central authority that manages and maintains the
                    value of a cryptocurrency. Instead, these tasks are broadly
                    distributed among a cryptocurrency’s users via the internet.
                    You can use crypto to buy regular goods and services,
                    although most people invest in cryptocurrencies as they
                    would in other assets, like stocks or precious metals. While
                    cryptocurrency is a novel and exciting asset class,
                    purchasing it can be risky as you must take on a fair amount
                    of research to understand how each system works fully.
                    Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, first outlined in
                    principle by Satoshi Nakamoto in a 2008 paper titled
                    “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” Nakamoto
                    described the project as “an electronic payment system based
                    on cryptographic proof instead of trust.” That cryptographic
                    proof comes in the form of transactions that are verified
                    and recorded on a blockchain.

                />
                <h2>What Is Blockchain?</h2>
                <p>
                    A blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records
                    transactions in code. In practice, it’s a little like a
                    checkbook that’s distributed across countless computers
                    around the world. Transactions are recorded in “blocks” that
                    are then linked together on a “chain” of previous
                    cryptocurrency transactions. “Imagine a book where you write
                    down everything you spend money on each day,” says Buchi
                    Okoro, CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange
                    Quidax. “Each page is similar to a block, and the entire
                    book, a group of pages, is a blockchain.” With a blockchain,
                    everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of
                    this book to create a unified transaction record. Each new
                    transaction as it happens is logged, and every copy of the
                    blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new
                    information, keeping all records identical and accurate. To
                    prevent fraud, each transaction is checked using a
                    validation technique, such as proof of work or proof of
                    stake.

                <h2>How Can You Use Cryptocurrency?</h2>
                <p>
                    While there are a number of goods and services that you can
                    buy with crypto, particularly with Litecoin, Bitcoin or
                    Ethereum, you may also use crypto as an alternative
                    investment option outside of stocks and bonds. “The
                    best-known crypto, Bitcoin, is a secure, decentralized
                    currency that has become a store of value like gold,” says
                    David Zeiler, a cryptocurrency expert at financial news site
                    Money Morning. “Some people even refer to it as ‘digital
                    gold.’” Using crypto to make purchases securely depends on
                    what you’re trying to buy. If you’re trying to make a
                    payment in cryptocurrency, you’ll most likely need a
                    cryptocurrency wallet. One type of wallet is a “hot wallet,”
                    a software program that interacts with the blockchain and
                    allows users to send and receive their stored
                    cryptocurrency. Remember that transactions are not
                    instantaneous as they must be validated by some form of
                    mechanism.
